My final assignment for the course will be an interactive Simpsons trivia game.
The application will display for the user a still from an episode along with the episode's title and summary.
Along with the episode information, the application will also display three images of Simpsons season cover art.
Two of the seasons will be random and one will be the season the episode is from.
The user simply has to guess the correct season and they are rewarded with a point and a plesant ding sound.
If the user selects the wrong cover art a buzz will sound along with text feedback and the correct season number will display.
Many Simpsons fans, including myself, consider the first 10 seasons of the show to be the "golden years" of the series.
For that reason the application will focus on those seasons. 

The Simpsons data will be pulled from the TVMaze API and I will use filter and map array methods to pull out the relevant episode information.
Sounds are played and loaded using a JavaScript library called SoundBox.
CSS is compiled from SASS. The API data and scores will be stored in the browser's local storage.
